It's getting hard to keep track of which ones are from the interwebs and which ones I like the most. Here's a list instead:
1. hulk.red
2. quick_lose.red (that one is a joke)
3. option1.red (don't use that, it sucks)
4. hog.red (The best one yet, testing on the sample warriors I found online to verify its integrity)
\\
beast.red is the best warrior I found online, will be the base warrior.

If my warrior can beat it, it's a good one.
